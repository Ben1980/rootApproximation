Methods:
 - [Bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
 - [Newton Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)
 - [Secant Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method)
 - [Dekker Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent's_method#Dekker's_method)
 - [Brent Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%27s_method)

## Getting Started

To get it up and running you just need to execute:
- `~\numericalIntegration\build\cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={YOUR_PATH_TO_VCPKG}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
- `~\numericalIntegration\build\cmake --build .`

You can execute the program by `./rootApproximation`
